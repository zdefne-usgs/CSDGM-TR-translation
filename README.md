# CSDGM-TR-translation
This projects aims at translating FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM) elements to Turkish. It is in support for Peter Schweizer's tool for creating and editing metadata, the Metadata Parser (mp). However, it can also be used for guiding any future attempts in creating Turkish metadata standards in coherence with the FGDC CSDGM.

<b>Please feel free to contribute to this effort if you are billingual and work with data and metadata!</b>
The complete list and explanation of CSDGM elements are given at https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/csdgm/
